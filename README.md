# Decentralized Digital Identity & Credential Vault

A project built to simulate decentralized identity and verifiable credentials. Users can issue, hold, and verify credentials without relying on a central authority.

## Overview

This project demonstrates a self-sovereign identity flow using Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs). IPFS and blockchain interactions are simulated for demo purposes.

## Working Flow

1. **Issuer Page**
   - Enter Holder DID, Credential Type, Description, and optional document.
   - Click "Issue Credential" to generate a Verifiable Credential JSON and a mock IPFS CID.

2. **Holder Dashboard**
   - Enter Holder DID to view all credentials issued to that DID.
   - Optionally share a proof placeholder for verification.

3. **Verifier Dashboard**
   - Enter Holder DID and select a credential from a dropdown list.
   - Click "Verify" to display a "Credential Verified" message using the proof placeholder.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: TypeScript
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Logic: JSON-based DID and VC simulation
